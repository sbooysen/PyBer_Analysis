# PyBer Analysis 
## By Stacey Booysen
For this analysis, we needed to present the company’s data to the CEO, V. Isualize, in a way that was clean and concise. By using various calculations and charting methods, we put together the appropriate chart type along with the display of the necessary data. In particular, she wanted Omar and I to display the data for ride-sharing by city, using a multiple line graph.

From the data that we analyzed, we produced the below chart:

In this chart, we can see that there is a noticeable spike of activity towards the end of February for all areas. Overall, the most of the revenue comes from urban areas. We can assume that the denser populated areas have shorter distances to cover per ride most of the time. This might be a contrast to a rural area where the stores and other locations may be farther apart, adding to the fare price.

As a result, rural and suburban areas tend to have a lower demand for ride-sharing programs, but the likelihood of them using PyBer can still be improved. It would be a good idea to consider lowering fare charges in rural areas to increase the likelihood of people in those areas choosing to use PyBer. The same could be said for suburban areas which have the second highest fare charges per ride, as seen below:

### Suggestions
#### PyBer Demand
Something else to consider is increasing the amount of drivers in the urban areas. Since it has the highest usage among the three areas, it’s safe to assume that more drivers would mean more revenue. With more people to cater to, it has more opportunities for income and one can surmise that more drivers would be able to reach more people.

Since the locations in rural areas may be farther apart, in turn pushing up the fare cost, there could be a discount or some type of incentive put in place to encourage continued use of PyBer. Something that might encourage weekly usage of the ride app in order to receive a lower overall fare. This is a bigger change than the other suggestions, however, so it would take a lot more work and investment.

### Analysis Conclusion
#### Final Thoughts
Overall, the urban areas require PyBer more than suburban or rural. While there is record of the other two types of areas using PyBer, with the fares so high, it might not be sustainable for a long time. Distance between locations, number of available drivers, and even the price of gas could affect why the rates in rural and suburban areas are so low. We can conclude from this data that there are clear areas with higher demand than others, but there are also still ways to improve the potential usage of PyBer in the areas with less use.
